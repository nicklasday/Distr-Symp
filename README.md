# Distr-Symp

Code for various computations surrounding the symplectification procedure for rank 2 distributions of Zelenko and Dubrov, 
as published in the article "On local geometry of nonholonomic rank 2 distributions" (Journal of London Mathematical Society, doi: 10.1112/jlms/jdp044).

Much of the code focuses on a basic implementation of the Lie algebra which arises from the symplectification procedure,
along with the computation of certain structure constants and invariants of the distributions. More details might be added to this
read me as the project develops.
